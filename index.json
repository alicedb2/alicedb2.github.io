Shown in green the SRF samples, in blue the DCM samples, in orange the MES samples, and in brown the MIX samples. There are two other types of samples, namely those shown in pink, which represents MES samples at the marine oxygen minimum zone, and in purple a DCM sample at the marine oxygen minimum zone. Six clusters are shows, three of them named after their main depth constituents (SRF, DCM, MES), and three of them after their location, CH for the coast of Chile, SO for the South Ocean, and AR/SWM for the Arabian sea and two stations far off the South-West coast of Mexico.  In this project I am interested in extracting organizing the entirety of the heterogeneity of responses across samples and clades along a phylogeny present in traditional 16S dataset. By responses we mean the difference in relative abundance between sister clades.\nWithout any metadata, namely any prior information on factors like temperature, salinity, or other variables along an environmental gradient, the generative model, called a path-limited nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (plnHDP), is able to reconstructed and organize samples and clades along a hierarchical representation of clusters and sub-clusters of responses. This reconstruction of the whole heterogeneity of responses is another way to say that we discover the structure of all confounding factors present in the dataset.\nThis analysis takes inspiration from the field of computational linguistics, namely corpus analysis and topic modeling.\nIn the figure above and using the TARA Ocean expedition dataset, we see how the model naturally recovers the known partition of microbial communities along ocean depth, and discovers a putative novel type of microbial community present in the Scotia see and on the coast of South Africa.\nThis analysis naturally leads to the enumeration of novel microbial units which can be thought as a coarse-grain alternative to OTUs or ESVs. Those units are any set of clades which spans the set of sub-clusters in the hierarchical tree. One such set of clades is shown below. Those alternative microbial units serve to simplify downstream correlation and ordination analysis in a way that goes beyond typical taxon-base analyses.\n  Hierarchical decomposition of a Zebra fish dataset of gut microbiome under different zinc diets    Putative microbial units in a dataset of Zebrafish guts under different zinc diets  ","date":1641168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641168000,"objectID":"4bc45e61979ce5509d7cf0990eb0074d","permalink":"https://alicedb2.github.io/project/unsupervisedlearning/","publishdate":"2022-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/unsupervisedlearning/","section":"project","summary":"Unsupervised learning approach uncovers contextually important microbial units","tags":["Unsupervised learning","Dirichlet process","GEM process","Microbial communities","Nonparametric"],"title":"Unsupervised learning of microbial units","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alice Doucet Beaupré"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639526400,"objectID":"0f40cf545adf79432be77d9037b7794b","permalink":"https://alicedb2.github.io/publication/thesis/","publishdate":"2022-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/","section":"publication","summary":" In this thesis we introduce two theoretical frameworks, one at the macroevolutionary scale with which we find universal quantitative similarities in the tempo and mode of microbial diversification, and the other at the mesoscopic scale where we discover a rich hierarchy of organization and niche signals in the pattern of microbial abundances in the global ocean and in the process identify three putatively novel microbiomes.","tags":["Diversification","Microbiome","Microbial ecology","Microbial units","Bursty","Unsupervised Learning","Dirichlet process"],"title":"Diversification Dynamics and Unsupervised Learning of Microbial Units in the Earth Microbiome","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project we explore the possibility of inferring full interaction matrices within a community (in our case microbial) using only O(1) community samples. This dramatic reduction in the size of the required dataset is made possible using ecologically and biologically justified assumptions. On one hand we assume that the shape of the interaction matrix is tree-structured, namely that it aligns itself with the underlying phylogeny between the species of the community. On the other hand we assume that the community is forever embedded in a stochastic environment which constantly perturbs it at random intervals. This latter assumption thus that the community is never observed at equilibrium.\nThe two figures below are visual representation of random asymmetric tree-structured interaction matrices following two different scenario for the way interactions have evolved through time. The first one assumes interaction strengths are dominated by the original innovation or nature of the geological event that led to a speciation event. The second one assumes that interaction strengths are sums of accumulations of evolutionary differences along the paths in the phylogeny.\n  Node-structured interaction matrix (indices have been shuffled on the right)    Edge-structured interaction matrix (indices have been shuffled on the right)  ","date":1631577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631577600,"objectID":"482d1312c07e16ac07684facb14a4812","permalink":"https://alicedb2.github.io/project/microbialinteractions/","publishdate":"2021-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/microbialinteractions/","section":"project","summary":"Using tree-structure Ansatz we infer asymmetric interaction strenghts using O(1) microbiome samples","tags":null,"title":"Inference of tree-structured microbial interactions","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I developed a coarse-grained inference framework to infer the tempo, mode, and shape of the global microbial tree of life using a novel diversification model called the birth, death, and heterogeneous innovation model. This approach has three favorable features. First, the model makes an explicit effort to acknowledge and capture empirical features of microbial phylogenies such as their “burstiness” and the effective lengthening of ancestral lineages due to unobserved extinctions and incomplete sampling. Second, the introduction of the heterogeneous innovation process overcomes the problem of parameter non-identifiability plaguing more traditional speciation-extinction models between the parameters characterizing the sampling fraction and the speciation rate. Third, the coarse-graining step overcomes the unavoidable problem of incompletely resolved phylogenies common to microbial datasets. Using this approach, I identified a previously unknown universality pattern inherent to microbial diversification. This universality manifests itself across a vast range of different microbiome through the appearance of a common exponent, ranging between 1.3 to 1.7, characterizing the tail of the burst size distribution in their phylogenies.\n   Definition of the Birth-Death-Heterogeneous Innovation model (BDH) and coarse-grained inference framework    Coarse-graining operation applied to a timetree \n","date":1631577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631577600,"objectID":"fae6eb309fb61704c9c638ce97c022ff","permalink":"https://alicedb2.github.io/project/diversification/","publishdate":"2021-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/diversification/","section":"project","summary":"Coarse-graining of microbial phylogenies characterizes bursty dynamics","tags":null,"title":"Microbial diversification dynamics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alice Doucet Beaupré","James P.
